# EnergyConsumptionCase

## Description
Predicting energy consumption (hourly) using Machine Learning & Deep Learning (comparison).

## Goal
As a DS student, my goals with this project are only to study a little bit more about time series cases, to implement a deep learning model and to compare with a XGBoost model.

## Dataset

## Folder Structure
The project has been organized in a linear manner to facilitate navigation and understanding of the step-by-step process.
